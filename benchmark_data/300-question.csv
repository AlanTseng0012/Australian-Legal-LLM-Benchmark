This contract obliged Crown to offer a renewal of the leases for five years on terms to be decided by Crown. The VCAT also determined that if this conclusion was incorrect, it would have accepted the tenants' submission that Crown was estopped from denying the existence of the collateral contract. The VCAT ordered Crown to pay the first respondent $467,505.00 and the second respondent $1,143,167.00 in damages for breach of that agreement."

Clause 2.3 of each lease provided that Crown was to give at least six months notice to the tenants prior to the expiration of the lease stating whether the Landlord will renew the lease, allow the Tenant to occupy the Premises on a monthly tenancy after the Expiry Date, or require the Tenant to vacate the Premises by the Expiry Date."

These representations were said to amount to a promise that Crown would exercise its power under cl 2.3(a) of the 2005 leases and offer a renewal for a further five year term. The tenants claimed to have been induced by the representations to execute the leases and to carry out the refurbishments. Two, alternative, legal consequences were said to follow from the promise: a collateral contract, by which Crown was obliged to offer the tenants further five year leases, came into existence, or an estoppel arose which prevented Crown from denying that obligation."

Q0115,https://www.hcourt.gov.au/sites/default/files/eresources/2016/HCA/26.pdf,"In the case of Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd [2016] HCA 26, what was the VCAT's finding regarding the alleged promise made by Crown to Mr Zampelis?",Question-Answering ,"In the case of Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd [2016] HCA 26, the VCAT found it improbable that Crown made the alleged promise to grant a renewal for the further term. However, it did accept that Mr Zampelis sought assurances from Crown about a longer lease term, because he believed that a longer trading period was necessary to recoup the substantial costs of refurbishment. The VCAT also found that on or about 6 December 2005 Mr Boesley made a statement to the effect that if Mr Zampelis spent the money that, under Crown's leases, the tenants were required to spend to achieve a major refurbishment to a high standard, he would be 'looked after at renewal time'. The VCAT made a specific finding that Crown had not expressly stated that it would renew the 2005 leases, but that Mr Boesley had said only that Mr Zampelis (and therefore the tenants) would be looked after at renewal time."

The promise to renew was of an existing five year lease and it was necessarily implied that the renewal would be for the same period. However, the promise did not require Crown to offer any particular terms to the tenants, other than the five year term. The terms which Crown was to offer were at its discretion."

It considered that the terms and conditions could be ascertained with certainty when Crown provided them in the notice for renewal. It did not matter that the terms were whatever Crown decided them to be, it was sufficient for an enforceable agreement that they would be ascertainable at that point."

This test is based on what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would necessarily have understood to have been intended.
